# Changelog

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-21 (build 26042102)

### Fixed
- Nickname field text on login was unreadable — it was painted the same color as the field background. Restored dark text color for proper contrast across device themes. (mockpvp 1.2.1)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-21 (build 26042101)

### Changed
- Local and CI builds now resolve submodule dependencies from the same source (GitHub Packages); lib-versions.properties is the single source of truth
- Bumped submodule versions: p2pkit 1.0.0 → 1.1.0, mockpvp 1.0.0 → 1.2.0

### Added
- Google Families Policy compliance: Firebase Analytics consent defaults (AAID/SSAID collection off, ad_* signals denied) and per-age-category consent applied at startup via AnalyticsManager.applyConsentForAge

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- Cross-game promotion cards in P2P lobby and tournaments
- Optional cryptography in P2P communication (disabled for game moves, reduces packet size ~85%)
- 15s per-turn countdown timer in Practice mode (color shifts at 10s/5s, vibration on final 5s, auto-loss on timeout); network turn timeout reduced 30s → 15s
- Android 16 KB page size compliance for native libraries (shared submodules)

### Fixed
- Duplicate variant selection dialog in WiFi/Bluetooth lobby
